Designing Places and Policies


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Introduction to the seminar and subject material.

What do urban designers do and why do they do it? What are the larger forces that help give direction to the types of projects that seem to be emerging as important? Is there a difference between the conception of urban design held by architects seeking to intervene at a larger scale and by planners seeking to improve the quality of the physical environment? On what basis do we (or should we) judge urban design quality?

Assessing the Current State of Urban Design


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Discussion of themes and cases to be discussed during March and April.

What are the important socio-environmental issues that urban designers must contend with currently? Which urban design approaches and agendas of the recent past now seem outdated and no longer "of the future"? How are urban design precedents set and transmitted? How is the nature of cities changing and how does this affect urban design practice?

Urban Design Competitions and How to Judge Them


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


What can be learned from the study of recent urban design competitions? What kinds of new urban fabrics are being proposed by leading urban designers? What are the strengths and weaknesses of urban design competitions as instigators of "good" urban design ideas?

Case: World Trade Center Master Plan and Memorial Competitions

Guest: Frank Sanchez, The Municipal Art Society (tentative)

Evaluating Urban Design


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


How should we judge "urban excellence"? Is this the same thing as "excellent urban design?" How do we judge the longevity and/or future significance of present day projects? Are these issues important?

Case: Rudy Bruner Awards, 2003

Guests: Rudy Bruner Foundation officials

Past Futures


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


How was the present envisioned in the past? What models of future urban form and function emerged in the 20th century? How effective were they in shaping the present? What do they say about current models of the future?

_Examples_

Industrial visions: Italian Futurists; "World of Tomorrow"  
Modernist visions: Broad-acre City; Radiant City  
"Go-go" visions: Metabolists; Archigram  
"No-go" visions: The 80's and 90's

Topic 1: Inventing New Ways of Living: Homes and Neighborhoods


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


How will demographic trends such as the aging population affect demands for housing design and the formation of neighborhoods? What will these trends mean for the existing urban housing stock?

House\_n MIT  
CyberHome, Chino Hills, CA

What effects will these changes have on real estate, development products and programming? What is the future of the high-rise office building? Factories? Other places of work?

_Examples_

Topic 4: Creating a City of Learning: Schools and Stories in the City


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


How can schools become "centers" for communities? Can the construction of design-enhanced narratives and designed arts and culture districts give new value to places? How can we come to terms with the merits and drawbacks of "themed environments?" Is a new kind of public realm emerging that merges information and form?
